# YNC Mods Website

A simple built website done on HTML and CSS. This website was submitted as our final group project, and built to test the functionality of Flask and SQLAlchemy for the module YSC2221 - Introduction to Python.

Team:
- Felix Wang
- Callista Yin
- Hana Miura

## Components of Website

- app.py = Where everything will be initialised. 
- The others (create, delete, reviewlist) are API blueprints, one API each to try to prevent conflicts 
- Try not to change the file names and blueprint names as it will affect the link up to app.py
- reviews.json file is a json db for any submitted reviews for a course. 
- templates is a folder where all the html files/pages will be stored.
